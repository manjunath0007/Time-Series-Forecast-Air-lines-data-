The following are the points discussed in the model:
- Time Series Concept & Its use cases
- Reading and Visualization of Time Series data.
- Observations / Time Series Components
- Importance of Normalizing the time series data (Non-Stationary Vs Stationary data)
- Discussion of Forecast techniques ( AR, MA & ARIMA )
- ACF & PACF (p & q values) 
- Evaluation of Time series model ( RSS score)
- Predicting and Visualization of outcomes or forecast values.
